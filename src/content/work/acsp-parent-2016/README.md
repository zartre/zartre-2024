These infographics and videos are parts of media used during Assumption Samutprakarn School's Parent Meeting 1/2016.
They were done in Adobe Illustrator and Adobe After Effects.
You might notice that there is a 4:3 video, as this is a looping video meant to be
displayed repeatedly on the screen during a live speech.

**Role:**
