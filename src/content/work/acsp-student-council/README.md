During my last year in secondary school,
I joined my friend in his new student council party as a public communications,
an IT assistant, and a graphic designer.
Our team really put an effort into re-branding the student council's image to be trustworthy:
being accessible and that advertised policies would be completed.

> The election was a huge success.
We operated the whole term transparently: 
everything we did was published online and communicated.
We completed almost every, if not all, policies we had proposed.
All activities gained high engagement.

I had proposed many ideas that were actually put in use.
On the first days of the party,
I had suggested that we should let students name the party,
so we ran a survey and received over 150 names.

We believed in constructing possible policies.
We also ran a survey asking the students what they want.

I had the duties to create promotional posters and videos.
Apart from that, I also led the idea of having a LINE@ account and a website,
which were then followed.
My tasks along the term were designing promotional materials,
doing PR stuff and giving advice on our operation.
