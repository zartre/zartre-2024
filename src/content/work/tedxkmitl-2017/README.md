TEDxKMITL 2017 – “Living out Loud” – is the first TEDx event in KMITL.
I, along with my team, had an opportunity to work on its website.
Here, the website is not just a place to present the event,
but also a central hub for all major systems such as registration, ticketing and in-event social board.

One of the most talked-about features is the ticketing system.
We’ve built the e-ticket system from the ground up.
Upon the completion of audience selection, e-tickets are generated from the database
containing eligible audiences and then the links are emailed to them.
At the registration desk, they can present the QR code on their e-tickets to the webcams on the laptops
running our Python program and that’s it.

During the event, we also had a monitor which acted as a social board where any guest could post their status updates onto.
It updated in real-time and, well, supported emojis.
