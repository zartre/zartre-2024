A website for the 2016's open house of Faculty of Information Technology,
King Mongkut's Institute of Technology Ladkrabang.

The website was built on Bootstrap framework to allow easy collaboration across the team
as the components and codes were globally understood.

On the performance side, we used modern Web practices to improve the performance and speed of the website
while not degrading overall design and experiences on each device.
This includes progressive JPEG's and SVG's.
HTTPS was also used by default on the faculty's domain.

**Role:**
- Front-end Developer
