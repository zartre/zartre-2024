My parents bought me and my sister a Yamaha digital piano
around 2008 (I guess).
Since then it has required no repair
but recently the sustain pedal is not working.
Following some tutorials on YouTube, I thought I may be able to fix it.

It was simple enough.
I just had to remove the main keyboard unit
so that I could flip the stand and get access to the pedal module.

After unscrewing the pedal, I had to remove the black plastic part
that connected the pedal to the potentiometer (a variable resistor).
This potentiometer controls the voltage for the sustain.

When the potentiometer is free from the pedal,
I had to turn it in both directions to the max multiple times
to kind of “exercise” it.
Then I assembled everything back together.

Voilà! It works.
