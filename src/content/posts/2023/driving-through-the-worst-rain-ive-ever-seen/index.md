This is a note to myself that today had the heaviest rain I've ever seen in my 25 years, and I had to drive home under the worst-ever visibility.

<!--more-->

I was on my way home which was about 20 kilometres, then it started to rain VERY heavily. The motorway where cars would usually drive at 120 km/h were then transporting 60 km/h traffic.

A short while passed and things went to chaos. The maximum wiper level only gained you 1 to 10 metres of visibility while traveling at 30 km/h. The winds were crazy. The rain was falling 90 degrees against the windshield. Road signs were unreadable, if they were even visible. At some point the visibility was zero and everybody almost came to a complete stop. You could see the wind whirling the raindrops in the sky like crazy. This continued for almost 10 kilometres. And your eyes had to fight with random lightnings.

That was both the heaviest rain I've ever seen in my life, and the hardest condition I've ever driven in.
