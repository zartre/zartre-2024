I'm tired of reading stuff with similar 'language' even though they are not from the same website or the same author. They sound the same and have a noticeably similar structure, yet come from different websites. That fake cheerful tone with perfect grammar.

It's easy to notice especially when the writing comes from people you know don't write in that _style_ and don't use perfect grammar. (I'm not criticising imperfect grammar here.)

I'm not a native English speaker either and I do make grammatical mistakes. It's OK to use AI to improve your writings. Just don't let it take on writing entirely. It's also OK if you make grammatical mistakes.

You don't need to let AI write your email.

You don't need to let AI write a farewell message.

You should never let AI complete an article on its own without verifying correctness.

Your writings say a lot about you. I can get to know you more through your writings. I want to see the sincerity and the soul in your writings which AI cannot express. Texts just seem bland and robotic coming out of AI. When I notice that a piece of writing is written by AI I just lose the mood to continue reading, knowing that it's not crafted by humans, rather a soulless computer.

I would rather read imperfect grammar than professionally generated AI texts because there is no person behind the texts for me to _connect_ to.

Writing is an expression, not just communication. It's part of you. Let it express who you areâ€”because _you_ can write.
